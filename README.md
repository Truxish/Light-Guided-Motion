# Approach to this project 
 * Reading the input images from the webcam
 * Converting images from rgb to hsv to remove the additional information from the image and make detection faster.
 * Applying gaussian blur to the images (same purpose removing the noise)
 * Morphological transformation of the gaussian blurred images
